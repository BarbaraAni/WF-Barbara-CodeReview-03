(25) Correct creation of the HTML structure based on JavaScript objects: show movie name, a short description and movie poster according to the provided design

(10) Add a button to every movie that calls a function that increments the movie’s “likes” property on every button click.

(25) Display movie’s “likes” property (number), that is also updated on the screen after clicking on the button “Like”
